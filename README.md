# Sparkler: Yet Another WordPress Starter Theme
I know, I know. Why even clutter up the GitHub servers with *another* starter theme... With amazing themes like [underscores](https://github.com/Automattic/_s) and [bones](https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones) out there, what's the point? Well, I've been making websites for the past 9 years or so, and around 2011 I created a front-end framework to help speed up development. (There wasn't much around then that I knew about.) And about a year after that I moved it into WordPress as a starter theme. It's improved my workflow a lot and helped streamline things. But you already know that. That's what starter themes are for. So anwyay, because I had this thing I made I didn't really see the need (or have time) to dig into other options. So I kept maintaining it. If it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?

And now, because I've kinda been in a bubble for the past 9 years, I thought it would be a good idea to finally put myself out there. So here goes! Worst case, GitHub is a great place to track changes for myself. Best case, maybe some small piece of this could help someone someday. Which would be the best thing ever!

## Features
I'll list out some of the features here soon. It's got all your basic mobile-first CSS, fluid grids, etc., along with some UI components and corresponding JS, and lots of shortcodes.

## Usage
I'll list out how to use it here. It's very simple but I don't feel like writing it out yet. :P
